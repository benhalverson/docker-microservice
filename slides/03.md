# Setup

The path of least resistance when it comes to AWS is using mananged services. This is what I selected. 

- Elastic Beanstalk
- CodePipeline
- Docker

## Elastic Beanstalk
  - managed EC2 instance that autoscales with a loadbalancer and managed keys.

## CodePipeline 
  - AWS version of a CI tool to deploy to various environments.

## Docker
  - I used Docker-compose for local development and Dockerfiles for deployment.
  - The benefit here is my Docker-compose file also used my Dockerfiles so I'm able to reproduce build issues locally without a lot of setup.
  - Reproduce an app on any host that supports Docker. I deployed my app to Windows(wsl2), OSX, and a Raspberry pi with Ubuntu.
